# Fashion MNIST Classification Project

This repository contains code for a Fashion MNIST classification project using TensorFlow, Keras, and Matplotlib. The project aims to build and train a neural network to classify images of fashion items from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

# Introduction

Fashion MNIST is a dataset of 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories, including shirts, dresses, shoes, and more. The goal of this project is to develop a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify these images accurately.

# Libraries
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
